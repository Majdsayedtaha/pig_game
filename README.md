Pig: A Classic Dice Game
-------------------------------------

Pig is a fun and engaging game that combines a dash of luck with strategic decision-making. This simple, turn-based game is perfect for casual play and can be enjoyed by people of all ages.

**Objective:**

The goal of Pig is to be the first player to reach a target score, typically set at 100 points.

**Gameplay:**

*   Players take turns rolling a single die.
    
*   After each roll, players have two options:
    
    *   **Hold:** Add the rolled value to their current turn total and end their turn. This score is then added to their overall score.
        
    *   **Roll Again:** Continue rolling the die with the chance of accumulating more points for the current turn.
        
*   **Rolling a 1 (One-Eyed Pig!)** This is an unfortunate turn of events! If a player rolls a 1, their entire turn score is lost, and the turn immediately passes to the next player.
    

**Strategic Decisions:**

The strategic element of Pig lies in deciding when to hold your score and avoid the risk of rolling a 1. A high accumulated turn score can be tempting, but the ever-present threat of losing it all with a single roll requires careful consideration.

**Variations:**

There are various ways to play Pig, with some allowing players to re-roll after getting a 1. However, in such variations, re-rolling carries the additional risk of losing all accumulated points for the turn.
